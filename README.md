## Django Stack
You can now spin up a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app and deploy it to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/) in seconds.

Using this stack as template would create a new repository for the codebase and deploy the Django app on Azure.

## Prerequisites 📖
Having an Azure account with an active subscription (Yes, that's it!! ) 🚀
Deployment happens on Azure Cloud via Azure App Service.

## What are the inputs to pass while setting up the stack? 📥
```
# Name of the Azure App which has been configured to host the website
- AZURE_APP_NAME

# Azure Publish profile
- AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE
```

## How to get AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE? 🔑
```
Login to your Azure Portal -> Open the Azure App Service -> Get publish profile
```
Check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/azure/how-to-get-publish-profile-from-azure-app-service?view=vs-2022) out for more details on getting Publish Profile.

## App hosted URL would be: ✈️

Once you create a repo out of this stack, you can find your website deployed at <azure_app_name>.azurewebsites.net.
```
Example: APP_NAME input by user is: sample-app
Hosted URL: https://sample-app.azurewebsites.net
